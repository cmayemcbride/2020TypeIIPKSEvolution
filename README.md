# 2020 Type II PKS Evolution   

### Welcome! ###       
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my 2020 Summer Research Project on Type II PKS Evolution! As a newbie to GitHub and a novice coder, I hope this repository helps you to understand my work. Please see Folder Descriptions below to better navigate through my various scripts and files. For a "research notebook" style description of my coding work, please reference the Wiki!    

### Folder Descriptions: ###   
  **Query Sequences:** Assortment of relevant query sequence text files.    
  **Blast Script Development:** Drafts of scripts used in BLAST attempts. Only some of these scripts are fully functional!      
  **Preliminary Raw Data:** Data collected during course of testing preliminary BLAST scripts. Only used for reference, not for use in further data analysis.
